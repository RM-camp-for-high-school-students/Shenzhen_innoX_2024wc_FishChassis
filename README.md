#### Additional Funciton
- How To Calibrate the IMU:
> Presse the user key while resetting the MCU, and buzzer would sound, indicating the start of the calibration program. It may take some time to pre-heat the imu. Buzzer will alternatively sound as the imu is calibrating. Once calibratetion is finished, the board will sound a long beep and reset.

> Calibration may take up to 4 minutes, so it's crucial to keep the board in releatively stable at all stages!!!


## General Information
#### Orientation
From a top view:   
![Top view](Doc/orientation.svg "Figure 1 Robot Orientation from Top View")

***RFU*** indicates that Right-Forward-Upward is the correct orientation for the chassis.
***Anticlockwise*** rotation direction is positive.
***ZYX*** rotation order is implemented on the robot.
***Right-Forward*** corresponds to the ID-0 wheel, with the IDs increasing counterclockwise.



#### Robot System Construction

![Construction](Doc/embedded_construction_here.svg "Figure 2 Robot System Block Diagram")

FishChassis serves as the foundational layer in the entire robot system. It facilitates basic closed-loop control for actuators and offers a control API for the upper layers.

Here are the details:

![Layer](Doc/system_layer.svg "Figure 3 FishChassis Block Diagram")

- Hardware Layer
  - Supports the running environment for programs.
- Operating System Layer
  - Supports basic system resource management.
- Service Layer
  - Supports advanced system services for apps, such as publisher-subscriber modules, USB-ACM service, etc.
- Task APP Layer
  - Implements user tasks to execute functions.

Here shows how system startup:

#### Communication
- USB-ACM
  - Operates  FishCom
  - Appears as tty-acm-x on Linux.
  - Simply plug in the micro-USB to the PC.
  - Well-suited for upper layers.
- SPI
  - Operates FishComLite.
  - Configured for ESP32-Arduino.
  - Not recommended for upper layers.
